How to run the app:

Problem1

1) I have implemented in Jupyter notebook which is using Pandas and ipython.

   "find_doctors.ipynb"

  I had quite a few challenges with getting the data, and some of them still dont work, but I did my best to write the code on how I would scrape the data.  Spent almost two full days working on it, though not all the code works but I really enjoyed working with this challenge and learnt a lot on how secured websites work.

  I would love to learn from "Reputation" on how to scrape thos website without any errors.


Problem2:

  I have written a html file: index.html 
  which can be run on any chrome browser to see the iframe of the reviews been rendered by third party.


All` the images are also stored for your reference on how I tried to gather the data.

I wish I had more time to play with this project, but unfortunately I have to work on my school projects.
